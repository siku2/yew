# Router Example

This example is mobile friendly too!

## Concepts

Uses [`yew-router`](https://docs.rs/yew-router/latest/yew_router/).

## Improvements

- Use a special image component which shows a progress bar until the image is loaded.
- Run content generation in a dedicated web worker
- Use longer Markov chains to achieve more coherent results
- Show posts by the author on their page
  (this is currently impossible because we need to find post seeds which in turn generate the author's seed)
