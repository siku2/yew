# Fragments Example

## Concepts

The example uses [fragments](https://yew.rs/docs/en/concepts/html/lists/#fragments) to have multiple root elements in the `html!` macro.

## Improvements

The example doesn't really make use of fragments in a way that requires them.
The same functionality and visual result can be accomplished without the use of fragments.

This example should use fragments for something that can't be easily replicated without them or be removed entirely.
Other examples already make use of fragments.
